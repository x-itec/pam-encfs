Note that the lack of activity means it's stable, I've been using it for ages without any problems whatsoever.

**Note, this is no longer actively maintained, but has been stable for a long time.**

**Note, version 0.1.3 and newer has flag "nonempty" on per default, this argument requires fuse 2.4 or newer.**
